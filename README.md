# Next Word Prediction using LSTM and GRU

This project implements next word prediction using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) models. It trains on text data to predict the next word in a sequence.

## Introduction

Next word prediction is a common task in natural language processing (NLP) that helps in building intelligent text-based applications like chatbots, auto-completion, and more. This project explores two popular recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures—LSTM and GRU—for next word prediction.

## Dataset

The project uses a corpus of text data for training. You can use any dataset that contains large volumes of sentences or paragraphs. Popular options include:
- Wikipedia text dumps
- Project Gutenberg books
- Custom datasets

## Models

### LSTM
LSTM is an advanced type of RNN that solves the vanishing gradient problem by introducing gates to regulate information flow.

### GRU
GRU is a simpler variant of LSTM that uses fewer gates but performs comparably well in many tasks.

Both models are used to predict the next word in a given sentence fragment.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.7+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)

You can install the dependencies using the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Results
Both LSTM and GRU models will generate predictions based on the trained text data. The performance and accuracy may vary depending on the dataset used and the number of epochs.
